      <title>Overview</title>

      <para>Open Journal Systems (OJS) is an open source solution to managing and publishing
        scholarly journals online. It is a highly flexible editor-operated journal management and
        publishing system that can be downloaded for free and installed on a local web server. It
        has been designed to reduce the time and energy devoted to the clerical and managerial tasks
        associated with editing a journal, while improving the record-keeping and efficiency of
        editorial processes. It seeks to improve the scholarly and public quality of journal
        publishing through a number of innovations, from making journal policies more transparent to
        improving indexing.</para>

        <para>The OJS interface can be <link linkend="customizing">extensively customized</link> by
          uploading new stylesheets at the site, journal, and article level, and by various other
          journal-specific customizations. For the advanced user, the underlying template system can
          also be modified. As open source software, you are free to customize OJS as you
          wish.</para>

        <title>Getting Help</title>

        <para>If you need help with OJS, there are several resources at your disposal.</para>

        <para>The Open Journal Systems platform has a help document that is contextually embedded
          within itself, with the relevant pages displayed depending on the page you are currently
          viewing. You can find this context-senstive help by clicking the <guibutton>Journal
            Help</guibutton> link (typically located on the right navigation bar). You can also view
          the help document at <link

          tutorials on our <link xlink:href="http://pkp.sfu.ca/tutorials">Tutorials
          page</link>.</para>

        <para>Our <link xlink:href="http://pkp.sfu.ca/support/forum">support forum</link> is an
          active place to find help with common and uncommon problems. We highly recommend you
          search the forum for past answers to questions, and post your own question if you can't
          find an answer.</para>

        <para>Finally, our <link xlink:href="http://pkp.sfu.ca/wiki">development wiki</link> is
          increasingly becoming a storehouse of developer-centric information, including specialized
          documentation on extending OJS theme- and plugin-wise; information on translating OJS; and
          roadmaps and general software milestone information.</para>

        <para>In addition, potential users of OJS may take OJS out for a test-drive – as a Journal
          Manager, Editor, or a Reviewer – at a second demonstration journal site that has been set
          up for this purpose at <link xlink:href="http://pkp.sfu.ca/ojs/demo/testdrive/"

        <title>Navigating OJS</title>

        <para>Open Journal Systems has been designed as a multi-journal system which can host any
          number of journals on a single installation. Visitors have access to overall site-level
          pages, and can navigate to any journals' individual pages from the site's home

          <para>OJS uses a comprehensive roles system to divide work between users, assign
            workflows, and limit access to different parts of the system. Since one installation of
            OJS can host multiple journals, users can be enrolled in different roles for more than
            one journal.</para>

          <para>When a user logs into the system, they will be taken to their User Home page. From
            here, they will see a list of the roles they belong to for each journal in the system
            (along with user-specific links to edit their profile, change their password, etc.). In
            the example below, the user has been enrolled a Site Administrator; as a Journal
            Manager, Subscription Manager and Editor for the Canadian Journal of Scholarly
            Publishing; and as a Journal Manager, Editor and Author for Demo Journal. A user might
            be an Editor in one journal (with all of the accompanying permissions), but only an
            Author on another (and limited to only performing Author tasks for that journal).</para>

          <para>Journals can be configured to allow users to self-enroll as Readers, Authors, and/or

                <para>Form Language: If you are working in a multilingual journal, you will need to
                  complete this form in all languages.</para>

              <listitem>
                <para>Journal Title: This field is mandatory. What you enter here will appear as the
                  new journal's title in it's header. You can change the journal title at a later
                  date, and Journal Managers will be able to change it, and upload header images,
                  from their journal management pages as well.</para>

                  new journal's URL, listed after <code>index.php</code>. For example, if your
                  journal title was Journal of Canadian Studies, you may want your path to be 'jcs',
                  or perhaps 'canstudies'. If you enter 'js', that journal's URL will be
                    <code>http://example.com/index.php/jcs</code>. You can come back to this page
                  and change the path value at a later date; be aware, however, that you may break
                  search engine and other links by doing so.</para>

          <para>OJS is designed to be a multilingual system, allowing journals supporting a wide
            variety of languages to be hosted under a single site. The Site Administrator can
            specify the default language of the site and install additional locales as they become
            available to make other languages available for use by journals. Journal Managers can
            then <link linkend="journalManagementLanguages">manage their own language

            as user-contributed translations are received. These packages can be installed into an
            existing OJS system to make them available to journals.</para>

          <para>To access your site's language settings, click the <guibutton>Languages</guibutton>

          <para>The Languages page is divided into three sections: Language Settings, Manage
            Locales, and Download Locales.</para>

          <para>The Download Locales section allows you to download new locales straight from the
            OJS website to your OJS install as they become available. To download locales, your
            server must be able to execute the <link xlink:href="http://www.gnu.org/software/tar/"
              >GNU tar utility</link>, and must be able to modify the locale registry file
              (<filename>registry/filename.xml</filename>). Locales can always be downloaded and
            installed manually -- see
            <!-- FIXME link to installing/translating languages -->.</para>

          <para>The Manage Locales section allows you to install new locales, reload existing
            locales in case you have updated locale files, and uninstall locales if they are no
            longer necessary. To install a new locale, check the box next to the locale name and
            click the <guibutton>Install Locale</guibutton> button. If you have modified a
            previously installed locale and would like to reload it, click the
              <guibutton>Reload</guibutton> link. To remove the locale from the list of installed
            locales, click the <guibutton>Uninstall Locale</guibutton> link.</para>

          <para>The Language Settings section allows you to enable locales to be used across the
            site as a whole, and also with journals. Locales that have been installed will appear in
            this section, with checkboxes next to their name. To enable locales to be available
            on-site, check the box next to their name and click the <guibutton>Save</guibutton>
            button. Users will then be able to choose the locale from the drop-down
            <!-- LINK HERE language menu --> on the right sidebar on all general site pages; Journal
            Managers will also now have the option of <!-- LINK HERE enabling locales --> for their
            journal (these locales will not be enabled at the journal level by default). to users on
            the site, check the box next to</para>

          <para>You can also choose the site's primary locale -- this is the locale that users will
            first see the site in when first visiting the web site, and will be the default language
            for any hosted journal.</para>

        <para>The Journal Manager manages the overall publishing system. This does not involve any

          The Journal Manager does the setup for the journal, and enrols the Editors, Section

        <para>The Journal Manager also has access to the journal's other management systems, and can

          <para>The Journal Manager sets up the journal, after the system has been installed on a
            web server, by working through five steps, filling in web-based forms and configuring
            the management of the journal. The setup does not have to be done all at once: the forms
            can be filled in and saved; then you can return to Setup to complete the task or make
            changes at any time.</para>

          <para>Setup is available to the Journal Manager on the Journal Management page, and
            contains its own set of Help texts built into each of the forms. Setting up the
            journal's web site will require decisions and text for the following items, among
            others, which can be prepared in advance in consultation with the Editors or added at a
            later point.</para>

                image-based header (.gif, .jpg, .png). A common size is 800px X 150px, but it can be
                as large or as small as you wish. The Logo Image allows you to add an image to the
                upper left corner of your site's home page. Often these are square image (e.g.,

              <para>Use this section to customize the appearance of your journal's homepage,
                including a description, an image, the table of contents for the latest issue, and
                any additional content. Experiment with what looks good, but be careful not to make
                it too busy! The appearance of your home page will be the first impression many have
                of your journal, and if it doesn't look professional, it will undermine its
                credibility. Take a look at what some of the many other OJS journals have done, and
                you'll be sure to find several examples that appeal to you.</para>

            with a text field for Authors and Editors, and a separate field for Editors only. By
            using the Review Forms, however, you can create web-based forms that include a variety
            of pre-set questions to guide your Reviewers and result in more consistent commentary.
            Setting up a new Review Form for the first time can be a little tricky, so follow these
            steps carefully.</para>

          <para>To create a new Review Form, select <guibutton>Review Forms</guibutton> from the
            Management Pages menu.</para>

            drop-down box (this also limits reviewers to selecting a single answer, but does so

            <para>Once a Review Form has been activated and used in at least one review, it cannot

              You can always stop using a form, or copy previous form items to new forms.</para>

          <para>From this page you can also quickly see how many forms are currently "In Review"
            (i.e., part of review that is still in process) or "Completed" (were used as part of a

          <title>Languages</title>

          <para>OJS can be made available to users in any of several supported languages. As well,
            OJS can operate as a multilingual system, providing users with an ability to toggle
            between languages on each page. Here is an example of a Russian journal using
            OJS.</para>

          <figure>

          </figure>

          <para>Using the language toggle in the sidebar, readers can switch from Russian to
            English. You can see that all of the OJS terms (About, Log In, Register, Search, etc.)
            have been translated (the system takes care of this). The content, however, must be
            translated by the journal. In the example below, the journal has not translated the
            titles for two of the journals, so they continue to appear in Russian.</para>

            Create Position Title option). This can be useful if you wish to have titles other than
            those provided by OJS (e.g., Editor-in-Chief, Managing Editor, etc.). To use this second
            option, change the radio button and hit <guibutton>Record</guibutton> (note, that last

            <para>The first step in setting up subscription management is to designate the types of
              subscriptions the journal offers. Journals typically offer individual subscription and
              institutional subscription rates. Some journals may have special offers for members of
              an organization or students. OJS will support the management of print and/or online
              subscriptions. More than one type of subscription can be created to cover longer
              periods of time (12 months, 36 months).</para>

            <para>To begin, select <guibutton>Subscription Type</guibutton> and from the resulting

              can also set the duration of the subscription, and whether it is individual (login
              required) or institutional (access via IP address or domain name -- e.g., sfu.ca).
              Lastly, you can require a membership for the subscription (perhaps for a reduced fee)
              and hide the subscription type from being published on the About page.</para>

          <para>System plugins allow OJS to expand its functionality, and accept contributions from
            participating developers, without altering the core of the program. If you are
            interested in writing a plugin for OJS, please contact us using the <link
              xlink:href="http://pkp.sfu.ca/support/forum">Support Forum</link>. There is a <link
              xlink:href="http://pkp.sfu.ca/support/forum/viewforum.php?f=28">special plugin
              gallery</link> on the forum dedicated to new plugins. The most widely used plugins are
            shipped with OJS by default, but it is always a good idea to check this gallery for new
            ones particular to your needs, as well as updated plugins. You can use the
              <guibutton>Upgrade Plugin</guibutton> option for each to upload the new files found on
            the forum. Most journals wait for any new plugins to be included with a new release of
            OJS, but if you need a new feature right away, this is the way to upgrade it.</para>

          <para>As a Journal Manager, you can decide which plugins to add to your journal, and which
            to leave out.</para>

          <para>Currently included plugins include an alternative user authentication system (LDAP),
            imports and exports, an indexing tool for Google Scholar, themes, block plugins for UI

          <para>This feature allows you to enrol an existing user into an additional role. For
            example, if Sally is currently registered as an author, but volunteers to become a

            <para>The Future Issues are where the Editor schedules submissions that are to be
              published next and into the future. The Editor may wish to ensure that there are
              always two or three unpublished issues, which enables submissions to be scheduled over
              a couple of issues (for reasons of balance, for example). Once an issue is created, it
              appears in the Future Issues list. A planned special issue is another example of a
              future issue.</para>

            <para>Every entry in the Future Issues list displays the issue title and as it was
              created by the Editor and as it will appear online; the number of items (edited
              submissions that have been scheduled with that particular issue; and a
                <guibutton>Delete</guibutton> option. clicking <guibutton>Delete</guibutton> will
              remove the issue from the Future Issues list, and all scheduled submissions will
              revert to their original unscheduled status (they will not be archived or deleted, nor
              will they be resubmitted for review: they will remain in Editing, but will have to be
              rescheduled).</para>

              <para>Clicking on an issue title in the Future Issues list will take you the issue's
                Table of Contents, Issue Data and Preview Issue pages.</para>

              <para>Clicking the <guibutton>Table of Contents</guibutton> link will display all
                submissions that have been scheduled against that issue, enveloped within their
                respective journal sections (e.g., Articles, Commentary, etc.). By default, journal
                sections are ordered as they have been ordered by the Journal Manager in the <link
                  linkend="journalManagementJournalSections">Journal Sections</link> configuration
                pages; articles are ordered by the date they have been scheduled. You can reorganize
                the order of both the journal sections and the articles by clicking the up and down
                arrows next to each item or by single-clicking and dragging an element with your
                mouse.</para>

              <para>Rearranging journal sections in one issue will not affect the order of
                already-published issues, and future issues will still default to the Journal
                Manager's prescribed order. After making changes, make sure to click the
                  <guibutton>Save</guibutton> button at the bottom of the page.</para>

              <para>Every submission entry in the Table of Contents displays the submission title as
                a link: clicking the link will take you to the submission's Summary, Review, Editing
                and History pages. There is also a checkbox you can check to remove the submission
                from that particular issue. Removing a submission from an issue will not delete or
                archive the submission: it will only 'deschedule' it, and you will have to
                reschedule it from its Editing page, or archive it from its Summary page.</para>

              <para>The 'Proofed' column shows which submissions have had the Author sign off on the
                final galley copy via the Proofreading process. Your journal may not rely on
                proofreading online, but this is a handy check to see whether Authors have had a
                final say on how their work has been represented.</para>

              <para>Finally, you have the <guibutton>Publish Issue</guibutton> button at the bottom
                of the unpublished Table of Contents. Clicking this will publish the issue, moving

            which the Journal Manager can select, as well as update and edit, in supporting the
            reading environment for the journal. The Reading Tools also enable Readers to join
            relevant forums, as well as contact the author or share the item with another
            Reader.</para>

          <para>The Tools enable Readers to look up words in the item (by double clicking on any
            work in the HTML version of the item); to email the author or another Reader; or to
            comment on the article. All of these features create a much more interactive reading
            environment. The Tools are also designed to take the first two keywords from the
            submission and feed them into the search engines of open access databases and other
            resources grouped under Research Studies, Author's Other Works, Press and Media,
            Government Websites, Instructional Resources, Discussions and Forums, and other
            categories, depending on the set of Tools selected. </para>

          <para>Readers are also able to access background information on each of the selected
            resources. In each category, whether Studies, Media, on Instruction, the Tools provide
            multiple choices or databases to consult, while allowing the Reader to learn more about
            each database by providing a link to an About page for the resource. (The Journal
            Manager is able to edit or delete existing resources and add new ones as well – see the

        <title>The Install Process</title>
        <para>There are a number of components to a successful OJS install: downloading and
          unpacking the OJS application files in a web accessible directory on your server; creating
          a separate <filename>files/</filename> directory that is not web accessible; and most
          likely, manually creating a database user and database.</para>

        <note>
          <para>All servers are different, and the installation process in your case may be
            different than what follows. If any of this confuses you or for some reason does not
            work, be sure to check the documentation that comes with OJS in the
              <filename>docs/</filename> folder, as well as the <link
              xlink:href="http://pkp.sfu.ca/support/forum">support forum</link> and <link
              xlink:href="http://pkp.sfu.ca/wiki/index.php/PKP_Frequently_Asked_Questions"
              >FAQ</link>. But also be sure to read your service provider and server documentation
            as well.</para>
        </note>

        <sect2 xml:id="systemDownloadUnpackPackage">
          <title>Download and unpack the OJS installation from the PKP website</title>

          <para>All OJS downloads can be found at <link xlink:href="http://pkp.sfu.ca/ojs_download"
              >http://pkp.sfu.ca/ojs_download</link>. Depending on your circumstances you will want
            to download either the most recent stable version (best for production systems) or the
            most recent development version (less stable but with more features). The install
            process is the same for both versions. In this example, we will use the development
            version, <filename>ojs-2.3.1-2.tar.gz</filename>.</para>

          <para>Unpack the <link xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tar_%28file_format%29">tar
              file</link>, and move the unpacked contents to a web-accessible directory on your web
            server from which you want OJS to run. A common web-accessible directory is
              <filename>/var/www/html</filename>, which we will use for this example.</para>

          <note>
            <para>Regarding web accessible directories: each server is different. If you do not know
              where your web-accessible directory is (that is, the directory where you put
              everything that you want people to see on your website; sometimes called a web root
              directory), you should contact your service provider. </para>
          </note>

          <para>If you did not download the tar file directly to your web server, you can untar the
            tar file on your desktop and transfer its contents by FTP, or you can transfer the tar
            file by FTP to your web server directly and run the following command:</para>

          <informalexample>
            <programlisting>tar xzf ./ojs-2.3.1-2.tar.gz</programlisting>
          </informalexample>

          <para>This will extract the OJS files into the directory
              <filename>/var/www/html/ojs-2.3.1-2</filename>. You may want to change the name of the
            directory to something more user friendly, such as "ojs". At this point, you should be
            able to go to that directory on your server, (ie. point your browser to
              <code>http://example.com/ojs/</code>) and see the install screen.</para>

        <sect2 xml:id="systemPrepareEnvironment">
          <title>Prepare Your Environment for the Install</title>

          <para>You will need to create a directory for OJS to store its submission files in. This
            should not be in a web-accessible directory, as then it would be possible for private
            files to be accessed online (eg. by savvy users attempting to point directly to the file
            in question by typing
              <code>http://www.example.com/files/journals/1/articles/1/submission/review/1-3-1-RV.doc</code>
            into their browser). If, for example, you have placed the OJS application files in
              <filename>/var/www/html/ojs/</filename>, you will have to create this directory
            outside of <filename>/var/www/</filename>.</para>


          <para>You will then need to grant file permissions so that the web server can administer
            and write to the <filename>public/</filename> and <filename>cache/</filename>
            subdirectories of the OJS installation path, the <filename>files/</filename> directory
            you just created, and the <filename>config.inc.php</filename> configuration file. The
            specifics of setting permissions will depend on your web server configuration, i.e.
            whether PHP scripts run SetUID. The install page will warn you if you don't have the
            appropriate permissions.</para>

          </figure>

          <para>In the above example, <filename>config.inc.php</filename> isn't writable by the
            server (which is not strictly necessary for normal functioning, although it is for
            automatic installation), and neither is the <filename>cache/t_cache/</filename>
            directory. Remember, all directories within <filename>cache/</filename> must be writable
            by the server.</para>

        <sect2 xml:id="systemCreateDatabase">
          <title>Configure Your Database Information</title>
          <para>You will need to create a database for the system to use, and also ensure that you
            have a database user that has sufficient permissions to operate the database. OJS can
            conceivably run on many different types of <link
              xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_relational_database_management_systems"
              >RDBMS</link>, although only PostgreSQL and MySQL are actively tested.</para>

          <para>For MySQL, you can create the database and user via phpMyAdmin or the MySQL command
            line interface. A CLI example follows:</para>

          <informalexample>
            <programlisting>$ <code>mysql -u root -p</code>
Enter password: 

Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
Your MySQL connection id is 95
Server version: 5.1.38 MySQL Community Server (GPL)

Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the current input statement.

mysql> <code>CREATE DATABASE ojs DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8;</code>
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.13 sec)

mysql> <code>GRANT ALL ON ojs.* TO pkpuser@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'password';</code>
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.15 sec)

mysql> <code>exit;</code>
Bye</programlisting>
          </informalexample>
          <para>In this example, the database is called <code>ojs</code>; the database user is
            called <code>pkpuser</code>; and the password is <code>password</code> (certainly not
            secure!). You will need those three pieces of information later.</para>
        </sect2>

        <sect2 xml:id="systemWebInstall">
          <title>Complete the Install from the Web</title>

          <para>Point your web browser to your OJS installation directory. You will see an OJS
            Installation installation page: fill in all of the form fields (including the database
            connection information you established previously; and under File Settings, the location
            of the <filename>files</filename> path you previously created) and click the
              <guibutton>Install</guibutton> button at the bottom of the page.</para>

          <para>You must configure your site's locale settings: not only the locales available for
            your users, but also character set options. If possible, change the last two from the
            default (shown) to "Unicode (UTF-8)". Unless your database server is particularly old,
            you should not run into any problems setting these options to Unicode. This will ensure
            better multilingual support.</para>

          <para>Next, choose your security settings. This configuration option specifies how system
            passwords are stored. SHA1 is more secure than MD5, so if your PHP version is 4.3.0 or
            above, choose the SHA1 option. </para>

          <para>You must then specify a username, password and email for the Administrator Account.
            After a successful install, you will use this account to log in and configure new
            journals; but typically, this account will not be used for the day-to-day running of a
            journal.</para>

          <para>Next is the Database Settings section. You must fill in the proper database
            connection settings: choose the correct database driver for your system; specify the
            correct host (normally <code>localhost</code>, but this could be different depending on
            your setup); the username and password of the database user; and the database name that
            they will be connecting to. If you have not yet created the database, then ensure that
            the "Create new database" checkbox remains checked; however, this option will not work
            if your database user does not have sufficient permissions to create databases, in which
            case you should create the database beforehand.</para>

        <para>A full back up of an OJS or OCS installation should include three components: the OJS
          system files; the <filename>files/</filename> directory you created on installation; and
          the database. There are many ways to make backups of these three components. Depending on
          the tools at your disposal you may be able to make backups entirely over the web via an
          administrative interface such as CPanel; or you may have to make backups via the command
          line. The following section demonstrates one way to back up files via the command
          line.</para>

        <note>
          <para>All servers are different, and the backup process in your case may be different than
            what follows. If any of this confuses you or for some reason does not work, be sure to
            check the documentation that comes with OJS in the <filename>docs/</filename> folder, as

          <para>By default, OJS uses PHP's <code>mail()</code> function to send email. You can
            configure OJS to use SMTP to send mail instead. To do so, you will need to uncomment and
            configure the relevant lines in <filename>config.inc.php</filename>, under the Email
            Settings subheading. Your final configuration might look something like the
            following:</para>

          <informalexample>
            <programlisting>
; Use SMTP for sending mail instead of mail()
smtp = On
    
; SMTP server settings
smtp_server = mail.example.com
smtp_port = 25
    
; Enable SMTP authentication
; Supported mechanisms: PLAIN, LOGIN, CRAM-MD5, and DIGEST-MD5
smtp_auth = PLAIN
smtp_username = username
smtp_password = password
</programlisting>
          </informalexample>

          <para>You will have to find the appropriate SMTP information (server, port, authentication
            type, username and password) from your ISP.</para>

          <para>To allow for notification of bounced emails (sent to the email address specified in
            <!-- LINK HERE --> Journal Setup 1.4) you will have to uncomment and enable the
              <code>envelope_sender</code> configuration option; you may also want to provide a
            default email address.</para>

          <informalexample>
            <programlisting>
; Allow envelope sender to be specified
; (may not be possible with some server configurations)
allow_envelope_sender = On

; Default envelope sender to use if none is specified elsewhere
default_envelope_sender = my_address@my_host.com
</programlisting>
          </informalexample>

          <para>There are a number of other email options in <filename>config.inc.php</filename> but
            they are sufficiently explained in the configuration file, and are rarely, if ever,
            changed from the default.</para>

              >CAPTCHA</link> challenges to prevent user registration and comment abuse. Find the
            CAPTCHA Settings section in <filename>config.inc.php</filename> and uncomment and change
            to the following:</para>

          <informalexample>
            <programlisting>
[captcha]

; Whether or not to enable Captcha features
captcha = On

; Whether or not to use Captcha on user registration

font_location = /usr/share/fonts/truetype/freefont/FreeSerif.ttf
                        </programlisting>

            <para>Please note that your server needs to support the IMLIB library for this to work,
              and that you need to point your <code>font_location</code> variable to a font that
              exists on your system, which may be different than the default provided.</para>

          <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
              <para>If you encounter a blank page, chances are there's a PHP error of some sort
                happening in the background. PHP errors are normally sent to your web server or
                system log file. To send any PHP errors to the browser, put the following line near
                the top of the root <filename>index.php</filename> file:</para>

              <informalexample>
                <programlisting>
ini_set('display_errors', E_ALL);
                        </programlisting>

              <para>When you rerun the task or reload the page you were having problems with, any
                PHP error messages that were being sent to the log files should now be displayed on
                the web page.</para>
            </listitem>
          </itemizedlist>

          <para>There are also a number of debugging variables in
              <filename>config.inc.php</filename>.</para>

          <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
              <para>You can set the system to display database output in the page header. Under the
                  <code>Database Settings</code> section of <filename>config.inc.php</filename>, set
                the <code>debug</code> variable to On:</para>

              <informalexample>

              <para>Turning database debugging on will display every database query for that
                particular page, regardless of any errors (or the lack thereof) in the page header.
                You may also see a few warnings about headers in the debug info too: those are
                harmless and can be ignored.</para>

              <para>With debug turned on, certain parts of the system may not function (for example,
                trying to log in). The debug option should only be used to try and diagnose a
                problem and may expose private information. Additionally, as the warning in the
                config file suggests, it is very verbose -- it prints out every database query
                regardless of whether the system has encountered an error, and so should not be
                turned on by default.</para>

            <listitem>
              <para>Turning on <code>show_stats</code> (Under <code>Debug Settings</code> at the end
                of <filename>config.inc.php</filename>) will display two execution stats in your
                footer: the time taken to generate the page, and the number of database queries. You
                may also see other warnings printed in the footer, such as if a locale key is
                missing.</para>

              <para>The <code>stack_trace</code> option (found just after the
                  <code>show_stats</code> option) will cause OJS to display a full dump of the
                current call stack if an error occurs. This makes it easier to find out where in the
                process of execution an error occurred, by displaying the full list of functions
                that are running at the time. It may expose a variety of private information,
                depending on where the error occurs, and should be left disabled on a production
                machine.</para>

      <sect1 xml:id="systemInstallingPlugins">
        <title>Finding and Installing Plugins</title>

        <para>OJS comes with a number of useful plugins by default, and more can be easily
          installed. You can view extra plugins at our Plugin Gallery online at <link
            xlink:href="http://pkp.sfu.ca/support/forum/viewforum.php?f=28"
            >http://pkp.sfu.ca/support/forum/viewforum.php?f=28</link>.</para>

        <para>Most plugins should come with a readme file of some sort, and should also list which
          versions of OJS they are compatible with. To install a plugin, you should simply need to
          copy the files to the correct <filename>plugins</filename> subdirectory in your OJS
          installation. For example, if the plugin you want to install is considered a 'generic'
          plugin, copy the plugin folder to <filename>plugins/generic/</filename>; if it is classed
          as an import plugin, it should go into <filename>plugins/importexport</filename>; and so
          on.</para>

        <para>Most plugins operate at the Journal Manager level, and require no additional system
          configuration -- that is, Journal Managers can enable and configure them once they are
          installed -- but some plugins require additional configuration at the system level. An
          example of a plugin that needs system configuration would be the COUNTER plugin (found in
            <filename>plugins/generic/counter</filename>), which requires a server-writeable logfile
          to be created on the server. For more information, you should consult the plugin's
          documentation.</para>

          <note>
            <para>sing this plugin to export articles and issues will not only export all relevant
              metadata, but will include all article files (HTML, PDF, etc.) embedded within the XML
              document in Base64 encoding. This can result in large, cumbersome XML files,
              especially when multiple issues are exported at once. Opening them in an editor to
              view or change any XML data or metadata may be taxing for your computer, and it may
              take some time to download and/or upload said files, depending on your connection and
              the resources of the source server.</para>

      <sect1 xml:id="expeditedSubmission">
        <title>Using the Web-based Expedited Submission Process</title>
        <para>If you only have a handful of files to import quickly, or if you don't want to depend
          on making XML files to import articles and issues, there is another way to expedite the
          submissions, available to Journal Managers from the 5-step Author Submission process. </para>

        <para>First, make sure you are logged in as a user who is enrolled as both an Editor and an
          Author. From your User Home, choose the Author Role, and start a submission. Fill out the
          first two steps of the Author Submission Process as you normally would, keeping in mind
          that you may need to modify the author metadata information if you are not the original
          author.</para>

        <para>When you reach Step 3 of the submission Process ("Uploading the Submission"), you
          should upload a galley file, as the file you upload here will appear in the final
          copyediting queue as both an Initial Copedit file, and as a Galley file. You will still be
          able to edit, add and remove any galley files at a later step, however. Please note, if
          you do not upload a file at this point, you will not have the option of expediting the
          submission process once you are done.</para>

        <para>Finish the rest of the submission process as normal. If you have uploaded a file, upon
          completion of Step 5 you will be presented with the option to move the submission directly
          to the last step of the Editing Queue. Clicking that link will take you from the
          submission process to the Editing queue.</para>

        <para>The file you uploaded appears both under Copyediting as an Initial Copyedit file, and
          under Layout, as a Galley file. For publishing's sake it is the galley file you are
          interested in. Double-check that the file format has been correctly identified (normally
          either PDF or HTML), view the proof, and upload any other galley files at this time as
          well.</para>

        <para>You can then schedule the submission under Scheduling, as you would for any other
          reviewed, copyedited file, and it will appear as soon as the issue it has been assigned to
          is published. In the case of it being assigned to an already-published issue, it will
          appear immediately in that issue's Table of Contents.</para>
